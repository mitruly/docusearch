# DocuSearch

## Background
DocuSearch is a case study that examines three text search techniques given a constraint of matching an exact search term
or phrase:
- Simple (in-order, in-line) matching
- Regex matching
- Index searching

While the first two techniques are well-defined, index searching is up to our interpretation as we need to create some type of
index by pre-processing the document files and utilize it for searching.
