Warp drive is a hypothetical faster-than-light (FTL) propulsion system in many works, most notably Star Trek. A spacecraft equipped with a warp drive may travel at apparent speeds greater than that of light by many orders of magnitude, while circumventing the relativistic problem of time dilation. In contrast to many other FTL technologies, such as a jump drive or the Infinite Improbability Drive, the warp drive does not permit instantaneous travel between two points; instead, warp drive technology creates an artificial "bubble" of normal space-time which surrounds the spacecraft (as opposed to entering a separate realm or dimension like hyperspace, as is used in the Star Wars, Stargate, Warhammer 40,000, Babylon 5, Cowboy Bebop, and Andromeda franchises).

Consequently, spacecraft at warp velocity can continue to interact with objects in "normal space". Some of the other fiction in which warp drive technology is featured include: Stars!, EVE Online, Earth and Beyond, StarCraft, DarkSpace, Starship Troopers, Doctor Who, and Star Ocean.
